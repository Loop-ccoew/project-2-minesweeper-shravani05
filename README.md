Welcome to the amazing minesweeper game!Let us go back to our childhood and play this fun game!
It contains 4*4 grid with some of the elements being the mine.
The game is for 2 players,if any of the two player selects the mine then game gets over for that player.
Player will be able to continue till he/she selects the mine or all the safe elements(not containing the mine).
The player able to avoid all the mines will eventually be the WINNER.
